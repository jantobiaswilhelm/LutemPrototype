## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✨ PRIMARY METHOD: Use Startup Scripts (ALWAYS)
```cmd
# Start backend (use this by default)
start-backend.bat

# Start frontend (use this by default)
start-frontend.bat

# Or start everything at once
start-lutem.bat
```

**Why these scripts?**
- ✅ Auto-detect JAVA_HOME
- ✅ Use Maven wrapper (no system Maven needed)
- ✅ Tested and reliable
- ✅ Handle all environment setup automatically

### 🔧 Alternative: IntelliJ (Only if requested)
**Backend:**
1. Open `backend/pom.xml` in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Build → Rebuild Project
3. Run `src/main/java/com/lutem/mvp/LutemMvpApplication.java`
4. Wait for: `"Started LutemMvpApplication"`

**Frontend:**
- Double-click `frontend/index.html`

**⚠️ Note:** Scripts are the primary method - IntelliJ is secondary

## 🎮 How It Works

### User Input (7 Parameters)
1. **⏱️ Available Time** - 5min to 3+ hours (discrete slider)
2. **🎯 Emotional Goals** - Unwind, Recharge, Engage, Challenge, Achieve, Explore (multi-select)
3. **🎮 Genre Preferences** - 20+ genres (Puzzle, Action, Strategy, RPG, etc.) - SOFT RANKING (optional)
4. **⏸️ Interruptibility** - Can you pause? (High/Medium/Low)
5. **⚡ Energy Level** - How much mental energy? (Low/Medium/High)
6. **🌙 Time of Day** - Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Late Night (optional)
7. **👥 Social Preference** - Solo/Co-op/Competitive

### Smart Recommendation Algorithm
**8-Tier Scoring System (115 points max):**
- **Time Match (30%)** - Game must fit your available time
- **Emotional Goal Match (25%)** - Aligns with desired mood
- **Interruptibility Match (20%)** - Matches your flexibility needs
- **Energy Level Match (15%)** - Suits your current mental state
- **Time of Day Match (5%)** - Optimal playing time bonus
- **Social Preference Match (5%)** - Solo/multiplayer fit
- **Satisfaction Bonus (max 10%)** - Previous user ratings
- **Genre Preference Boost (max 15%)** - SOFT RANKING: Boosts score for preferred genres without eliminating other matches

### Output
- **Top Recommendation** with golden crown badge, game image, and 95% match indicator
- **3 Initial Alternatives** - Best matches shown immediately
- **"See 6 More Alternatives" Button** - Reveals additional 6 recommendations on click
- **Match explanation** - Why each game was selected
- **Interactive feedback** - 1-5 emoji rating system for continuous learning

**Progressive Display Strategy:**
- Shows **top 4 games initially** (1 top pick + 3 alternatives)
- **"See More" button** appears if more than 4 recommendations exist
- **Expands to show all 10 games** (or however many were recommended)
- **Smooth animation** when expanding alternatives
- **Button disappears** after expansion (clean UX)

**Why Progressive Display?**
- Prevents overwhelming users with too many choices (decision fatigue)
- Highlights the best matches first (top 4 are usually the best fit)
- Allows exploration without forcing it
- Faster initial page load and perceived performance

**Example:**
```
Input: 30 min, Unwind + Achieve, High flexibility, Low energy, Evening, Solo

Top Pick: Unpacking (92/100) 👑
[Game Image]
95% Match
→ "Perfect for: fits your 30 min, unwind, low energy, highly rated by you"

Initial Alternatives (shown immediately):
1. Stardew Valley (88/100) - "Relaxing farming, achievable goals"
2. PowerWash Simulator (85/100) - "Meditative cleaning, easy to pause"  
3. Dorfromantik (82/100) - "Peaceful puzzle, evening-friendly"

[See 6 More Alternatives Button]

Additional Alternatives (shown after clicking):
4. A Short Hike (79/100) - "Cozy exploration, low commitment"
5. Baba Is You (76/100) - "Clever puzzles, mental stimulation"
... (up to 10 total recommendations)
```

## 🧠 Why This Works

Lutem isn't just another recommendation algorithm - it's built on psychological principles and gaming research that explain why traditional game discovery often fails.

### The Problem with Traditional Discovery

**Decision Paralysis:**
- Modern game libraries contain 100-1000+ titles
- More choices = More anxiety (Barry Schwartz, "The Paradox of Choice")
- Players spend more time browsing than playing
- Result: Frustration, abandoned sessions, and lower satisfaction

**Engagement-First Metrics:**
- Steam, Xbox, PlayStation optimize for "hours played"
- Longer sessions = Better metrics ≠ Better experience
- Ignores emotional state, energy levels, and real-world constraints
- Can lead to burnout and negative gaming experiences

**Genre-Only Filtering:**
- Traditional systems: "You like RPGs, here are 500 RPGs"
- Ignores context: A 2-hour RPG at 11pm after work might be terrible
- Misses perfect matches from other genres
- Creates filter bubbles and reduces discovery

### Lutem's Evidence-Based Approach

**1. Multi-Dimensional Matching (8 Factors)**
*Research Basis:* Personalization systems that consider multiple contextual factors significantly improve user satisfaction and reduce information overload (Liang et al., 2006, "Personalized Content Recommendation and User Satisfaction").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Time availability (prevents incomplete sessions)
- Emotional goals (mood-aligned gaming)
- Energy levels (cognitive load matching)
- Interruptibility needs (real-world flexibility)
- Time of day (circadian rhythm optimization)
- Social preferences (solo/co-op/competitive fit)
- Genre preferences (soft ranking, not filtering)
- Satisfaction history (continuous learning)

**2. Emotional Satisfaction Focus**
*Research Basis:* 88.4% of gamers report positive emotional benefits from gaming when games match their emotional needs, including stress relief and mood enhancement (Hazel et al., 2022, "Mental Health Benefits of Video Games").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Prioritizes "how you'll feel" over "how long you'll play"
- Matches games to 6 emotional goals (Unwind, Recharge, Engage, Challenge, Achieve, Explore)
- Considers energy levels to prevent mental fatigue
- Optimizes for satisfaction, not just engagement time

**3. Soft Ranking vs Hard Filtering**
*Research Basis:* Recommendation systems that use soft ranking (boosting scores) instead of hard filtering (eliminating options) maintain diversity while respecting preferences, reducing filter bubbles and improving discovery (Ziegler et al., 2005, "Improving Recommendation Lists Through Topic Diversification").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Genre preferences boost scores (+15% max) but never eliminate games
- Preserves cross-genre discovery (e.g., puzzle lovers finding great strategy games)
- Prevents over-specialization and gaming echo chambers
- Surfaces unexpected gems that match emotional needs

**4. Progressive Disclosure**
*Research Basis:* Presenting information in stages reduces cognitive load and prevents decision paralysis (Nielsen Norman Group, "Progressive Disclosure").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Shows 4 games initially (top pick + 3 alternatives)
- "See More" button for deeper exploration (optional)
- Guided setup modal with 3-step onboarding
- Collapsible advanced options
- Reduces overwhelm while maintaining depth

**5. Feedback-Driven Learning**
*Research Basis:* Continuous learning systems that incorporate user feedback improve recommendation quality over time and build trust through transparency (Choung et al., 2022, "Trust in AI and Its Role in Acceptance of AI Technologies").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Post-session emoji feedback (1-5 scale)
- Updates game satisfaction scores
- Influences future recommendations (up to +10% score boost)
- Transparent scoring: always explains WHY a game was recommended
- Builds trust through explainability

**6. Context-Aware Timing**
*Research Basis:* Time-of-day affects cognitive performance and preferences. Evening sessions favor relaxing activities, while morning sessions support higher-energy tasks (Schmidt et al., 2007, "A Time to Think: Circadian Rhythms in Human Cognition").

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- Optional time-of-day input (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Late Night)
- Games tagged with optimal playing times
- Considers energy levels in combination with time
- Prevents mismatched recommendations (e.g., high-intensity games when tired)

**7. Wellness Integration**
*Research Basis:* Gaming can support well-being when balanced with real-world needs. Excessive session lengths can lead to negative outcomes (Digital Wellness Research, 2024).

**How Lutem Applies It:**
- "Touch Grass" modal for 3+ hour sessions
- Encourages breaks, movement, hydration
- Respects time constraints (prevents overcommitment)
- Frames gaming as part of balanced lifestyle

### The Result: Better Gaming, Less Stress

Lutem transforms gaming from:
- ❌ "Endless scrolling through libraries"
- ❌ "Starting games that don't fit your mood"
- ❌ "Feeling guilty about gaming choices"
- ❌ "Burnout from poorly-timed sessions"

To:
- ✅ **Instant, confident recommendations** (under 3 seconds)
- ✅ **Emotionally aligned gaming** (matches your mood and energy)
- ✅ **Guilt-free leisure** (respects your time and well-being)
- ✅ **Continuous improvement** (learns from your feedback)

### 🎮 Genre Preference System (SOFT RANKING)
**NEW FEATURE:** Intelligent genre preference without over-filtering

**20+ Genre Options:**
- 🧩 Puzzle • ⚔️ Action • 🎲 Strategy • 🗡️ RPG • 🎯 Platformer
- 🏎️ Racing • ⚽ Sports • 🎲 Roguelike • 🃏 Card Game
- 🔫 Tactical FPS • 👻 Horror • 🏗️ Sandbox • 🎉 Party Game
- 📊 Management • 🏡 Life Sim • 🕵️ Social Deduction
- ⛺ Survival • 🤝 Co-op Adventure • 👾 Arcade • 🚜 Farming Sim

**How It Works:**
- **Multi-select chip interface** - Click genres you enjoy
- **Soft ranking approach** - Boosts preferred genres (+15% max score)
- **Never eliminates games** - Prevents over-filtering
- **Intelligent scoring** - Calculates match percentage based on overlap
- **Optional feature** - Leave blank for standard recommendations

**Why Soft Ranking?**
Traditional hard filtering (showing ONLY selected genres) can:
- Eliminate excellent matches that don't perfectly fit genre tags
- Reduce recommendation quality by ignoring other 7 scoring dimensions
- Create artificial barriers to game discovery

Lutem's soft ranking:
- ✅ Prioritizes your genre preferences
- ✅ Still considers emotional fit, time, energy, etc.
- ✅ Surfaces unexpected gems you might love
- ✅ Maintains recommendation quality and diversity

**Example:**
You select "Puzzle" and "Strategy":
- Games with both genres get +15% boost
- Games with one genre get +7.5% boost  
- Games with neither genre still eligible if they match other criteria
- Result: Smart prioritization without missing great recommendations

### 🎯 Results Display
**Top Recommendation Card:**
- 👑 Golden "Top Pick" badge
- 🖼️ Large game cover image (Steam header)
- 📊 "95% Match" percentage overlay
- 📝 Game title, genre, description
- ⏱️ Time range (min-max minutes)
- ⚡ Energy level required
- ⏸️ Interruptibility (pause flexibility)
- 💡 Match reason explanation
- 😊 1-5 emoji feedback buttons

**Alternatives Section:**
- Grid layout (responsive)
- 3 alternative games
- Medium-sized game images
- Title, genre, match reason
- Time and energy metadata
- Hover effects with elevation

### 🔄 Feedback System
- **5 emoji ratings**: 😞 😕 😐 😊 🤩
- **Instant submission** to backend
- **Updates game satisfaction** score
- **Influences future recommendations**
- **Success confirmation** message
- **Persistent tracking** across sessions

### 🎯 Multi-Dimensional Matching
Goes beyond simple genre matching:
- Considers emotional state (6 goals)
- Respects energy levels (3 levels)
- Accommodates flexibility needs (3 types)
- Optimizes for time of day
- Matches social preferences
- Learns from satisfaction feedback

### 🔄 Transparent Recommendations
Always explains WHY a game was recommended:
- Shows scoring breakdown
- Lists matching attributes
- Provides context for alternatives
- Displays match percentages

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0, Java 17+
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)
- **Build**: Maven 3.9+ (use provided startup scripts)
- **Storage**: In-memory HashMap (future: PostgreSQL)
- **API**: RESTful with JSON
- **CSS**: Custom properties for theming
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with async/await

### Frontend Architecture
```javascript
// State Management
const state = {
    selectedGoals: [],
    availableMinutes: 30,
    energyLevel: null,
    interruptibility: null,
    timeOfDay: null,
    socialPreference: null
};

// API Communication
async function getRecommendation() {
    // Validation → API call → Display results
}

// Theme Management
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
root.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
```

---

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```cmd
# Option 1: Use reliable startup script
start-backend.bat

# Option 2: Deep clean + rebuild in IntelliJ
force-clean.bat
# Then: Build → Rebuild Project
```

### IntelliJ serves old code
**Problem:** Build cache not updating  
**Solution:** Always use `start-backend.bat` (uses Maven, never caches)

### Port 8080 already in use
```cmd
# Find process using port
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Frontend can't connect
1. Verify backend console shows: `"Started LutemMvpApplication"`
2. Check browser DevTools (F12) for errors
3. Confirm backend URL is `http://localhost:8080`
4. Check CORS configuration in GameController

### Dark mode not persisting
- Check browser localStorage (DevTools → Application tab)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

### Results not displaying
1. Open DevTools (F12) and check Console for errors
2. Verify API response in Network tab
3. Check that backend returned `topRecommendation` (not `game`)
4. Ensure all 20 games have valid `imageUrl` fields
